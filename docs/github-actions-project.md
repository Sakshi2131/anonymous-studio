# Automating Projects using Actions

## How GitHub Project Automations Work

GitHub offers two layers of project automation:

### 1. Built-in GitHub Projects Automations

GitHub Projects (v2) includes a set of **built-in workflow automations** you can enable directly from the project settings (Project Settings → Workflows). These run automatically without any custom code:

| Automation | Trigger | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Item added to project** | An issue or PR is added | Sets a field value (e.g. Status → Todo) |
| **Item closed** | An issue or PR is closed | Sets a field value (e.g. Status → Done) |
| **Item reopened** | A closed issue or PR is reopened | Sets a field value (e.g. Status → In Progress) |
| **Pull request merged** | A PR is merged | Sets a field value (e.g. Status → Done) |
| **Auto-archive items** | Item matches a filter (e.g. closed for 2 weeks) | Archives the item from the board |
| **Auto-add to project** | A new issue or PR is opened in a configured repo | Adds the item to the project automatically |

You can enable or disable each automation in **Project Settings → Workflows**. Each workflow lets you pick which field and value to set when triggered.

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

For more advanced or custom logic, you can write **GitHub Actions workflows** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) that call the **GitHub GraphQL API** to read and update project data programmatically. This lets you:

- Add items to a project when specific events happen (e.g. PR marked ready for review, issue labeled, commit pushed)
- Update custom fields such as priority, date, or team assignment
- Move cards between status columns based on CI results or review approvals
- Archive or remove stale items on a schedule

Because `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to the repository and cannot access Projects, workflows must authenticate using either a **GitHub App** (recommended for organization projects) or a **personal access token** with the `project` scope.

## Most Popular Project Automations

The following are the most widely used project automation patterns in GitHub Projects:

1. **Auto-add issues and PRs to a project** — Automatically add every new issue or pull request from a repository to the project board so nothing is missed. Enabled via the built-in "Auto-add to project" workflow.

2. **Set status to "In Progress" when a PR is opened** — When a pull request is opened or a branch is linked to an issue, automatically move the linked issue to the *In Progress* column.

3. **Set status to "Done" when an issue or PR is closed/merged** — Keep the board accurate by moving items to *Done* automatically when work is finished.

4. **Add PR to project when marked "ready for review"** — Automatically track pull requests that are ready for human review; this is the workflow demonstrated in detail below.

5. **Triage labeling on issue open** — Use an Actions workflow triggered by `issues: opened` to assign a label (e.g. `needs-triage`) and add the item to the project with a *Todo* status.

6. **Auto-archive closed items** — After a configurable period (e.g. 2 weeks), closed items are archived from the board to keep it focused on active work.

7. **Schedule-based stale issue management** — Run a workflow on a cron schedule to label or close issues that have had no activity for a defined number of days (commonly implemented with the [`actions/stale`](https://github.com/actions/stale) action).

8. **CI status → project field update** — When a CI workflow passes or fails, update a custom project field (e.g. *Build Status*) on the linked card so the board reflects current build health.

You can use GitHub Actions to automate your projects.

## GitHub Actions workflows

This article demonstrates how to use the GraphQL API and GitHub Actions to add a pull request to an organization project. In the example workflows, when the pull request is marked as "ready for review", a new task is added to the project with a "Status" field set to "Todo", and the current date is added to a custom "Date posted" field.

You can copy one of the workflows below and modify it as described in the table below to meet your needs.

A project can span multiple repositories, but a workflow is specific to a repository. Add the workflow to each repository that you want your project to track. For more information about creating workflow files, see [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](/en/actions/quickstart).

This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of GitHub Actions. For more information about GitHub Actions, see [GitHub Actions documentation](/en/actions).

For more information about other changes you can make to your project through the API, see [Using the API to manage Projects](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-api-to-manage-projects).

You may also want to use the **actions/add-to-project** workflow, which is maintained by GitHub and will add the current issue or pull request to the project specified. For more information, see the [actions/add-to-project](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project) repository and README.

> \[!NOTE]
> `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to the repository level and cannot access projects. To access projects you can either create a GitHub App (recommended for organization projects) or a personal access token (recommended for user projects). Workflow examples for both approaches are shown below.

## Example workflow authenticating with a GitHub App

For more information about authenticating in a GitHub Actions workflow with a GitHub App, see [Making authenticated API requests with a GitHub App in a GitHub Actions workflow](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/guides/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow).

1. Create a GitHub App or choose an existing GitHub App owned by your organization. For more information, see [Registering a GitHub App](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app).

2. Give your GitHub App read and write permissions to organization projects. For this specific example, your GitHub App will also need read permissions to repository pull requests and repository issues. For more information, see [Modifying a GitHub App registration](/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/editing-a-github-apps-permissions).

   > \[!NOTE]
   > You can control your app's permission to organization projects and to repository projects. You must give permission to read and write organization projects; permission to read and write repository projects will not be sufficient.

3. Install the GitHub App in your organization. Install it for all repositories that your project needs to access. For more information, see [Installing your own GitHub App](/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/installing-github-apps#installing-your-private-github-app-on-your-repository).

4. Store your GitHub App's ID as a configuration variable in your repository or organization. In the following workflow, replace `APP_ID` with the name of the configuration variable. You can find your app ID on the settings page for your app or through the App API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for apps](/en/rest/apps#get-an-app). For more information about configuration variables, see [Store information in variables](/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows).

5. Generate a private key for your app. Store the contents of the resulting file as a secret in your repository or organization. (Store the entire contents of the file, including `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.) In the following workflow, replace `APP_PEM` with the name of the secret. For more information, see [Managing private keys for GitHub Apps](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps). For more information about storing secrets, see [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

6. In the following workflow, replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with the name of your organization. For example, `octo-org`. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER` with your project number. To find the project number, look at the project URL. For example, `https://github.com/orgs/octo-org/projects/5` has a project number of 5. In order for this specific example to work, your project must also have a "Date posted" date field.

## Example workflow authenticating with a personal access token

1. Create a personal access token (classic) with the `project` and `repo` scopes. For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
2. Save the personal access token as a secret in your repository or organization.
3. In the following workflow, replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the name of the secret. Replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with the name of your organization. For example, `octo-org`. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER` with your project number. To find the project number, look at the project URL. For example, `https://github.com/orgs/octo-org/projects/5` has a project number of 5.
